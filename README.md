JamMaster's MFCC-CNN model is a cutting-edge tool designed specifically for generating high-quality backing tracks tailored for guitar recordings. Leveraging the power of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs), this model excels in capturing the intricate nuances of guitar performances and producing accompaniments that seamlessly complement them. By analyzing the spectral characteristics and temporal dynamics encoded in MFCCs, the model learns to generate rich and expressive musical accompaniments that enhance the creativity and performance of guitarists. Whether you're looking to jam along, practice, or record your next masterpiece, JamMaster's MFCC-CNN model is your ultimate companion for creating captivating backing tracks.

However the accuracy of the first model which is for identifying guitar chords was lower than expected(0.8374), The dataset is need to be modified.I'm using my own dataset here prepared by using two real accoustic guitars and one real electirc guitar, and the others are recordings from virtual guitars.

The final model is still under research and development , The plan is to create a desktop application powered by AI to create a jamming environment for guitar players.
